### 1. **Project Structure**

   - **Main Process**: Controls the game's overall flow and initialization.
   - **Referee Process**: Coordinates and controls the bungee jumping sequence, including sending signals to initiate actions and determining when players can start and stop.
   - **Team Processes**: Each team (A, B, and C) has three player processes.
   
### 2. **Processes and Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

   - Use **pipes** to communicate scores and status between the referee and players, ensuring data is passed along without interfering with process timing.
   - Use **signals** to initiate and synchronize actions between the referee and team players (e.g., start jump, stabilize, and pull up actions).
